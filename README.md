## About The Project

During my app development course, I identified a significant bottleneck in the ideation phase: the time-consuming and often incomplete process of competitor analysis. To address this, I designed and built LaunchLens, a frontend prototype for a tool that gives developers and entrepreneurs instant feedback on their ideas.

The goal was to create a clean, modern, and intuitive interface where a user could get aggregated results from app stores, GitHub, and the web, all presented in a beautiful and easy-to-digest format. This project focuses heavily on creating a premium user experience with a polished design and smooth interactions, built entirely with foundational web technologies.

While researching, I discovered a commercial product solving a similar problem, which validated the market need for such a tool and provided a clear benchmark for the UI/UX I aimed to create.

## Key Features

‚ú® **Modern Glassmorphism Design:** A beautiful, frosted-glass aesthetic with subtle shadows and glows that creates a sense of depth and sophistication.

üé® **Dynamic Light/Dark Theme:** A sleek, animated slider toggle that allows users to switch between light and dark modes, with their preference saved in `localStorage` for a persistent experience.

‚öôÔ∏è **Interactive Loading State:** An animated and informative loading indicator that cycles through different stages of the "analysis," making the wait time feel active and engaging.

üì± **Fully Responsive:** The entire layout is fluid and optimized for a seamless experience on all devices, from small mobile screens to large desktop monitors.

üîÑ **Dynamic Content Rendering:** All results are dynamically generated and injected into the DOM using vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating strong foundational skills in DOM manipulation.

üöÄ **Built with Web Fundamentals:** No frameworks were used. This project is a showcase of proficiency in pure **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**, proving a strong understanding of core web technologies.

## Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the application.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including Flexbox/Grid layouts, custom properties (variables) for theming, and all animations.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For all interactive logic, including event handling, state management, and dynamic content generation.
